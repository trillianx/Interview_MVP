# Gaussian Mixture Models

A Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is a probabilistic model that assumes that all the instances in the dataset are generated by a set of $k$ Gaussians with a set of parameters (mean and variance). Unlike, [[k-Means]] clustering, which is a **hard-clustering** technique where either an instance belongs to one cluster or not, the Gaussian Mixture Model is a **soft-clustering** technique. This technique computes the probability of each instance belonging to the set of $k$ Gaussians and assigns it to a cluster with the highest probability.

## How Does it Work?

GMM works as the following: 
1. As the parameters of the Gaussians are unknown, the [[expectation-maximization]] algorithm begins by creating a set of $k$ Gaussians with random mean $\mu$ and a constant variance $\sigma^2$. Because a random set of $\mu$ are selected, they are placed at random positions. For 1D, the Gaussians have the following form: 

$$
G(\mu, \sigma) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma}}exp(-(\frac{x - \mu}{\sigma^2}))
$$

2. Conditional probability (use of Bayes' Rule) for each instance is computed. This is the probability that a given instance belongs to a $k$th Gaussian. So, we compute the posterior probability as: 

$$
b_i = P(b_i|x_i) = \frac{P(x_i|b)P(b)}{P(x_i|b)P(b) + P(x_i|b)P(a)} \\[15pt]
$$

$$
a_i = P(a|x_i) = 1 - b_i
$$


3. The means and the variances of each of the Gaussians are recomputed based on the posterior probabilities of each of the observations. This would be the weighted means and variances or the expected mean and expected variance. This is where we have soft part of the soft-clustering. So, for the blue points, we have have the updated means:

$$
\mu_b = \frac{\sum b_ix_i}{\sum b_i}
$$

$$
\sigma^2_b = \frac{\sum b_i(x_i-\mu_i)^2}{\sum b_i}
$$


4. Repeat steps 2 - 3 until a stopping condition is reached.

The priors are generally selected as $P(b) = \sum b_i/n$ and $P(a) = 1- P(b)$. 

This is shown graphically as follows:

The above example is for 1D. We can extend this to multiple dimensions.
