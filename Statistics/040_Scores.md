## z Scores

At the heart of [[021_Normal Distribution]] is the [[z score]]. Z scores allow us to standardize distributions such that distributions of different shapes can be compared on the same footing. 

A z-score is a unit-free standardized score. It is a unit of measure of the distance of a given score from the mean in terms of the multiple of standard deviations. 

The **z-score** is computed using the following equation:

$$z = \frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}$$

where  $X$ is the original score while $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are the mean and the standard deviation, respectively, for the normal distribution of the original scores.

A z-score consists of two parts:

-   a _positive_ or _negative_ sign indicates whether it is above or below the mean
    
-   a _number_ indicates the size of its deviation from the mean in standard deviation units

## More about z Scores

z scores are not limited to normal distributions. Non-normal distributions can also be transformed into sets of unit-free standardized z scores. It is just that in such cases, the standard normal table cannot be used. The z scores effectively normalizes the scores then allowing comparison of two or more distributions on the same footing.
