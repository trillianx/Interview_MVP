# Probability Distributions

Rather than looking at [[Frequency Distribution]], which tells us the number of times the scores occurred, we can look at how likely that a score would occur? This will give the probability of a given score occurring. 

## Normal Distribution

Statisticians have calculated the probability of certain scores occurring in a [[standard normal curve]]. Remember, a standard normal curve is a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. Now, the obvious problem we face is that not all curves are normal. But the good thing is that we can always transform a curve into a normal curve using [[z score]]. 

Once the transformation is done, we can find a z-score of a certain value and by looking at the standard normal distribution table, we can find the probability of that score. 

> We see that the normal distribution and z-scores allow us to go a first step beyond our data in that from a set of scores we can calculate the probability that a particular score will occur. 

This tells us whether certain scores are more likely than others. As we will see later, this is very useful for analysis. But for now, let's look at two z-scores that are important: 

* $1.96$ - This cuts off the top 2.5% of the distribution. Likewise, $-1.96$ cuts off the bottom 2.5% of the distribution. In other words, 95% of the scores lie between $\pm1.96$.
* $\pm2.58$ and $\pm3.29$ cut off 1% and 0.1% of the scores respectively. In other words, they contain 99% and 99.9% of the z-scores between those values. 

Remember these values as they crop up time and time again. 

The figure below shows the standard deviation, the z-scores, and the cumulative percentage.
