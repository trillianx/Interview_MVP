# Statistics

If you look at the definition of statistics you will find that statistics is the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data. In other words, it is a framework that we use in order to understand or address a problem. 

The problems we wish to address can come through observations or experiments. For example, if we wish to know whether there is a relationship between the sunrise and the blooming of certain flowers or whether creating fine grounds results in stronger coffee. All of these questions can be answered through statistics. 

## Framework

The statistics framework is also known as the **scientific process** or the [[research process]] and it works in the following way: We start wtih an observation or a research question we wish to answer. Through observations, we create a [[theory]]. In order to test whether the theory is sound, we collect [[011_Data Types]]. Of course, we cannot use random data, but data that allows us to test our theory. So, we first go out and identify the **variables** we need. Variables are simply a thing that can change or take on different values. For example, weight is a variable as it can take different values. Now collecting data corresponds to measuring the variables we have identified. Then we use the data to test our theory. The prediction from our theory is called a [[hypothesis]]. 

We analyze the data we have collected so far to see if it can validate our theory. If it does, we have a theory that can explain the observation or a research question. However, if the data contradicts our theory, we have [[falsification]]. Falsification is an act of disproving a hypothesis or theory. If the data contradicts our theory we adapt our theory and start the process again. As the figure below shows, the research process is iterative.
