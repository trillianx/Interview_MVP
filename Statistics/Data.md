# Data & Statistics

Statistics is the study of variability in the data. This data comes from observations. A [[population]] is any complete collection of observations or potential observations that exist around us. So, a population can be large, sometimes it can be small. When the population is too large it is impossible to collect all the observations from it. Therefore, in order to better understand the population, we do [[random sampling]]. A random sampling is a process in which each sample from the population has an equal probability of being picked. 

There are two types of statistics: the [[descriptive statistics]] provides tools to describe, summarize, and organize variability in the observations while [[inferential statistics]] uses of [[sample]] from the[[ population]] and generalizes the properties of the population from the limited set of samples. 

Observations, by themselves, come in two parts.[[Surveys]] make use of random sampling to generalize the population from the samples. Surveys do not change the anything but simply understand the population. [[Experiments]] on the other hand, randomly sample units from the population. In a simple experiment, units are randomly sampled from the population. These units are broken into two groups: control and treatment. A single parameter is changed in the treatment while nothing is changed in the control. Then the difference between the control and treatment is computed to determined if this difference is real or transitory. This is known as A/B test or a hypothesis test. When there are more than one parameter, this is known as multivariate A/B test. 

Data is a collection of observations from surveys or experiments. Data comes in two flavors: [[qualitative data]] consists of categories such as Male/Female, Red/Blue/Green. This is known as [[categorical data]] and [[quantitative data]] which consists of numbers. 

Data also has subcategories: 

* [[Nominal data]] - is a categorical data type to which a number is assigned. But these numbers by themselves have no mathematical operations. For example, cricket players have numbered jerseys. These numbers have no arithmetic operatios. 
* [[Ordinal data]] - is a categorical data type which is associated numbers. These numbers have an order but do not have any arithmetic operations. For example, the degree of burns. 
* [[Interval data]] - is a quantitative data type where each number has equal interval and one can perform arithmetic operations. An example, is the centigrade scale. 
* [[Ratio data]] - is a quantitative data type where each number has an equal ratio. Ratio data can perform arithmetic operations. 

A variable, also called parameter, can take on different values. A variable can be categorical or quantitative. If a variable takes a value that does not change. It is known as a [[constant]].  A variable that take only specific values, such as natural numbers is called a [[discrete variable]] while if it can take any values, such as rational numbers, then it is called a [[continuous variable]]. 

Variables can be [[independent variable]] when they are not influenced by other variables and [[dependent variable]] when they are influenced by independent variables. Dependent variables are also called [[outcome variables]].  

[[Observational study]] focus on detecting relationships between variables without any manipulation of the parameters or the units. [[Experiments]] on the other hand manipulate the variable to determine whether the outcome is to the manipulation or chance. 

The two figures below summarize an experiment and an observational study:

Somtimes there is no direct connection between an indepedent variable and a dependent variable. A third variable [[confounding variable]] influences the dependent variable. Therefore, in a experiment care must be taken to remove confounding variables.
