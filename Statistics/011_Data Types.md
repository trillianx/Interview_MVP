# Data Types

As we saw in [[010_Statistics]], data collection is vital for testing theories. When we collect data we need to decide on two things: 

1. What to measure? 
2. How to measure? 

## What to Measure?

As we saw in the previous section, a variable a simply a thing that varies. Generally, when working with a theory, we can express a hypothesis in terms of two variables: a proposed [[cause]] and a proposed [[effect]].  A variable that is a cause is known as an **independent variable** while the variable associated with an effect is called a [[dependent variable]]. 

The variables themselves comes in two flavors: [[013_Qualitative data]] consists of categories such as Male/Female, Red/Blue/Green. This is known as [[categorical data]] and [[Quantitative data]] which consists of numbers. 

Generally speaking we can divide the type of data into two buckets: 

* Categorical Data:
	* [[Nominal data]] - is a categorical data type to which a number is assigned. But these numbers by themselves have no mathematical operations. For example, cricket players have numbered jerseys. These numbers have no arithmetic operatios. 
	* [[Ordinal data]] - is a categorical data type which is associated numbers. These numbers have an order but do not have any arithmetic operations. For example, the degree of burns. 
* Quantitative Data:
	* [[Interval data]] - is a quantitative data type where each number has equal interval and one can perform arithmetic operations. An example, is the centigrade scale. 
	* [[Ratio data]] - is a quantitative data type which is an interval data but also where each number has an equal ratio. 

 If a variable takes a value that does not change. It is known as a constant.  A variable that take only specific values, such as natural numbers is called a [[discrete variable]] while if it can take any values, such as rational numbers, then it is called a [[continuous variable]]. 

### Measurement Error

As we have seen, in order to test the hypothesis, we need to measure variables. But it is also important to measure these variables accurately. Accuracy here means that these when these measurements are performed over time, ideally, they give us the same value in time and situation. However, we notice that the values when measured repeatedly or in different situation are not exactly the same. This discrepancy is known as **measurement error**. 

In order to reduce the measurement error, we need to do two things: (1) ensure that the instrument measures what is suppose to measure. This is known as **validity** and (2) the measurement is consistent when measured across time and situation. This is known as **reliability**. In other words, we want to ensure that the instrument used to measure the variable measures what it is designed to measure and that its measurement is consistent.
