# Normal Distribution

Normal distribution is one of the most important [[Distributions]] in statisitcs. This is because it is a distribution that is extremely well studied. It is used extensively in [[inferential statistics]] as we will see later. For any given normal distribution, if we know the [[Mean]] and the [[standard deviation]], we can use a standard normal table and get the properties of the distribution. 

Let's look at some properties on a normal distribution. 

* The total area under the curve is 1
* A normal distribution is a theoretical curve defined by a [[continuous variable]]
* The lower half of the normal curve is the mirror image of its upper half
* The peak of the normal distribution is at the center, or the midway of the distribution
* The mean, mode, and the median coincide and are located at the midway point. 
* The standard deviation of the normal distribution controls the width. Smaller standard deviation correspond to normal distributions that have narrow width while large standard deviation corresponds to a wider distribution. 

## z Scores

At the heart of normal distribution is the [[z score]]. Z scores allow us to standardize distributions such that distributions of different shapes can be compared on the same footing. 

A z-score is a unit-free standardized score. It is a unit of measure of the distance of a given score from the mean in terms of the multiple of standard deviations. 

The **z-score** is computed using the following equation:

$$z = \frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}$$

where  $X$ is the original score while $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are the mean and the standard deviation, respectively, for the normal distribution of the original scores.

A z-score consists of two parts:

-   a _positive_ or _negative_ sign indicates whether it is above or below the mean
    
-   a _number_ indicates the size of its deviation from the mean in standard deviation units

## More about z Scores

z scores are not limited to normal distributions. Non-normal distributions can also be transformed into sets of unit-free standardized z scores. It is just that in such cases, the standard normal table cannot be used. The z scores effectively normalizes the scores then allowing comparison of two or more distributions on the same footing. 

## Standard Normal Curve
A [[standard normal curve]] is a normal curve with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. 

If a curve is approximately normal, it can be converted to a standard normal curve through the conversion of z-scores. In other words, take the mean and the standard deviation of a curve. Compute the z-score for all of its scores. The resultant distribution is a standard normal curve. 

The advantage of a standard normal curve is that to find the probability of a given score or proportion between two scores, we can use the standard normal table to get the answer.
