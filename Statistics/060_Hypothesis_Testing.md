# Hypothesis Testing

Having looked at the data, we begin creating statistical models to explain the data. These models, as we have seen in [[050_Population_and_Samples]] allow us to go beyond the data and generalize what we observe. Much of statistics deals with creating models to fit the data at hand. 

As we have seen in other sections, the hypothesis is predictions that a theory makes. There are two types of hypothesis: 

1. A hypothesis states that the effect is present. This is known as the [[alternative hypothesis]]. It is represented by $H_1$. 
2. A hypothesis states that the effect is not present. This is known as the [[null hypothesis]]. It is represented by $H_0$.

The reason we have the null hypothesis is because accepting or rejecting it based on the data at hand gives credence to the alternative hypothesis. It is very hard to prove the alternative hypothesis but rejecting the null hypothesis tells us that the data at hand supports the alternative hypothesis. While if we cannot reject the null hypothesis, we say that our data does not support the alternative hypothesis. 

Rather that rejecting the null hypothesis, we try to determine the chances of obtaining the data we've collected assuming that the null hypothesis is true. If these changes are small, it is credence to the alternative hypothesis while if the chances are large, it diminishes credence to the alternative hypothesis.
