# Normal Distribution

Normal distribution is one of the most important [[020_Distributions]] in statisitcs. This is because it is a distribution that is extremely well studied. It is used extensively in [[inferential statistics]] as we will see later. For any given normal distribution, if we know the [[Mean]] and the [[standard deviation]], we can use a standard normal table and get the properties of the distribution. 

Let's look at some properties on a normal distribution. 

* The total area under the curve is 1
* A normal distribution is a theoretical curve defined by a continuous variable
* The lower half of the normal curve is the mirror image of its upper half
* The peak of the normal distribution is at the center, or the midway of the distribution
* The mean, mode, and the median coincide and are located at the midway point. 
* The standard deviation of the normal distribution controls the width. Smaller standard deviation correspond to normal distributions that have narrow width while large standard deviation corresponds to a wider distribution. 

## Standard Deviation

The standard deviation in a normal distribution tells us a lot about where the scores lie: 

* 68% of the scores lie within 1 standard deviation
* 95% of the scores lie within 2 standard deviations
* 99% of the scores lie within 3 standard deviations


## Standard Normal Curve
A [[standard normal curve]] is a normal curve with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. 

If a curve is approximately normal, it can be converted to a standard normal curve through the conversion of z-scores. In other words, take the mean and the standard deviation of a curve. Compute the z-score for all of its scores. The resultant distribution is a standard normal curve. 

The advantage of a standard normal curve is that to find the probability of a given score or proportion between two scores, we can use the standard normal table to get the answer.
