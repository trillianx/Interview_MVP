# Mathematics of Deep Learning Chapter Summaries

These are the summaries of each of the book chapters. 

## Chapter 1: Introduction

There are three core topics in machine learning: 

*   **Data** - are used to extract valuable information and patterns that help a ML system make predictions. Data is often represented by vectors or matrices
*   **Models** - are used to learn from the data and generalize the patterns to unseen data. 
*   **Learning** - happens when the model learns from the data through optimization of model's hyperparameters such that the cost function, a user-defined metric to measure performance, is reduced. 

ML is can thought of as a construction of a foundation and four pillars:

*   ML Foundation:
    *   **Linaer Algebra** - 
    *   Analytic Geometry
    *   Matrix Decomposition
    *   Vector Calculus
    *   Probability & Distributions
    *   Optimization
*   Pillars that rest on the foundation:
    *   Regression
    *   Dimensionality Reduction
    *   Density Estimation
    *   Classification
