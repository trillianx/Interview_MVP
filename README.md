# Machine Learning Interview Preparation

I would like to start interview around the second week of June. This gives me 3 months from today to prepare myself for the interviews. This is the interview guide I want to prepare myself for. Here are a wide range of topics that I should be familiar in, which also includes specialization. If I am able to complete early, I will look into specializing [Image processing](https://www.deeplearning.ai/program/generative-adversarial-networks-gans-specialization/) for [AI for Medicine Specialization](https://www.deeplearning.ai/program/ai-for-medicine-specialization/).  

-   [ ] Machine Learning 
-   [ ] Deep Learning
-   [ ] Statistics
-   [ ] A/B Testing
-   [ ] Data Structures & Algorithms
-   [ ] Natural Language Processing (Targeted specialization)
